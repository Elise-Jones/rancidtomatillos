## Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
We used this project to learn the fundamentals of React, React Router, and Cypress from scratch, and are ending the project with confidence that we can independently build applications that rely on these three technologies in the future. We also used this opportunity to practice building an application that is fully responsive across large, medium, and small devices.

This was an exciting introduction into E2E testing, where as previously we had only done unit testing with Mocha/Chai. It was fascinating to learn how E2E testing can positively affect the look, feel, and flow of an application. Learning React, and especially using Router, was terrific because of how much easier it is to navigate through a site, and to write the code that makes it possible. Learning about the efficiencies and abilities of React was particularly fun.

One of the most difficult parts of making this application was learning how Cypress navigates through the page during testing. At first, it was a challenge to understand which elements Cypress was trying to access before making assertions. Luckily, the Cypress documentation was clear and well-organized, and we were able to efficiently locate the solutions to our problems. In the end, we developed a robust testing suite that comprehensively walks through the user flow and ensures a tight, usable UI.


## Plans For Future:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Many of the features we wanted to implement were outside the scope of this small project. In future iterations, however, we would consider adding the following capabilities:
- Filter & sort movies by name, rating, and genre
- Allow users to save a list of favorite movies
- Allow users to save a watchlist
- Allow users to mark movies as watched
- Search bar
- Comments/reviews section
- Add movie banner as background image on movie page
